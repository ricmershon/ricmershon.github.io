# Ric Mershon Portfolio
Ric Mershon Developer Portfolio

## Goals
Create a portfolio site that not only showcases my work, but also showcases a collection of basic web coding skills&mdash;HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery in order to demonstrate mastery in those areas. Apps within my portfolio demonstrate mastery in more advanced technologies, like React.js, GraphQL, MongoDB, Node.js, etc.

## Features
* Coded from the ground up in HTML.
* CSS uses the Bootstrap framework.
* JavaScript and JQuery to control dynamic elements.

### A Variety of HTML Elements
More advanced elements used:
* Modal box to display tech specs for individual apps. The same modal box is used for each app using ```event.relatedTarget``` and HTML ```data-*``` attributes to determine data to be displayed.
* Collapsible section for resume.
* Carousel component for publications.
* Contact form using a PHP backend.
